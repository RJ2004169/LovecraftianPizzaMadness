# LovecraftianPizzaMadness
This is a group project, developed a 2D Time Management/Kitchen Simulator game

This game, developed in Unity, is set in a space diner which is run by Lovecraftian creatures for Lovecraftian creatures. The only human in this wierd world is you. The aim of the game is to progress through all the weird pizza orders that come in during each day. You also slowly lose your sanity and once it is completely drained, you are forced to go into your personal locker where you can play with your stress toy to get your sanity up.
